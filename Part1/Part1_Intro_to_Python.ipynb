      "The goal of the first two classes is to build a *Change Blindness* experiment. We will work with pairs of images that only differ on a tiny detail, for example, a green traffic light might turn into red in a typical street scene. We will continuously switch between both images until the participant observes a difference between the two. In addition, half of the image pairs will be presented upright, whereas half will be inverted. To make the changes more difficult to detect, we will have bubbles of various sizes superimposed on the images, which will be repositioned to new random locations upon each image switch. When the participant detects the change, she should hit spacebar. Otherwise, after 30 seconds the experiment advances to the next stimulus. At any time, the participant can press escape to quit the experiment.\n",
